# Visualizing Anxiety-Related Structural and Functional MRI Data

**Author**: Tianxin Shu  
**Date**: December 15, 2025  

## Project Description
This project visualizes Structural and Functional MRI data related to the concepts of "Anxiety" from Neurosynth.org. The goal is to explore and analyze brain activity patterns associated with these concepts. The notebook includes steps for loading, visualizing, and analyzing the MRI data to better understand the spatial distribution of brain activity.

## Table of Contents
1. **Data**:  
   - Structural MRI data: `*anatomical.nii`  
   - Functional MRI data: `anxiety*.nii`  
2. **Notebook**:  
   - The main notebook for this project is `anxiety.ipynb`. It contains all the code for loading, visualizing, and analyzing the data.  
3. **Outputs**:  
   - Visualizations of the statistical maps and histograms of voxel intensities.  

## Python Packages Used
The following Python packages are required to run the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `nibabel`
- `nilearn`
- `os`
- `glob`
- `requests`
